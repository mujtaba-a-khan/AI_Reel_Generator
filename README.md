# AI_Reel_Generator

This project aims to explore the capabilities of AI in automated video generation by developing an AI-powered Reel Generator. The system takes a news article URL as input, scrapes the content, generates a structured video script, creates AI-generated images, generates realistic voice narration, adds subtitles, and compiles everything into a fully edited short-form video.

The goal is to demonstrate the power of AI in automated multimedia production, evaluating how well different deep learning models can be combined to create engaging short-form content.
