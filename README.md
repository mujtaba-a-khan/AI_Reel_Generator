# AI_Reel_Generator

# 1. Introduction
This project aims to explore the capabilities of AI in automated video generation by developing an AI-powered Reel Generator. The system takes a news article URL as input, scrapes the content, generates a structured video script, creates AI-generated images, generates realistic voice narration, adds subtitles, and compiles everything into a fully edited short-form video.

The goal is to demonstrate the power of AI in automated multimedia production, evaluating how well different deep learning models can be combined to create engaging short-form content.
 
# 2. Use Case & Relevance
Why is this use case interesting?

1) Growing Demand for Short-Form Video Content: Platforms like YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels have dominated digital media consumption, creating a high demand for quick, engaging content.
2) Automating Video Creation: Traditional video production is time-consuming. This AI-powered solution automates the entire process, reducing human effort.
3) Accessibility & Scalability: Anyone can use the tool to generate videos without prior editing skills.
4) Potential Business Applications: The system can be extended for marketing, education, and news content generation, allowing journalists, influencers, and educators to quickly create engaging videos.

# 3. How the System Works
1.	Web Scraping: Uses Crawl4AI to extract content from a news article.
2.	Script Generation: GPT-4o-mini analyzes the article and creates a structured video script with scene-wise narration.
3.	AI Image Generation: DALLÂ·E 3 generates scene-specific images based on the script.
4.	Text-to-Speech (TTS) Conversion: Deepgram converts text narration into realistic AI voice.
5.	Subtitles Processing: The system syncs subtitles with the generated audio using Pysrt.
6.	Final Video Compilation: Uses FFmpeg to merge images, audio, and subtitles into a final Reel video.
